# GPU-programming-basics

> **_NOTE:_**  The content of this repository works only with NVIDIA graphics driver. I have an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 in my device, and I use CUDA to talk to it. A lot of the stuff are taken from the GPU sessions of the HSF-India training event (1-5 May 2023, TIFR, Mumbai). The session was taught by Brij Kishor Jashal (TIFR).
